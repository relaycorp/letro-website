# Letro

Like email, but end-to-end encrypted, spam-free, phishing-free and works without the Internet too.

## Overview

Letro is a service like email, but it's designed to solve the challenges we face in the 21st century. Like email, Letro will be decentralised and based on open standards. Unlike email, all messages will be end-to-end encrypted, spamming and phishing will be virtually impossible, and users could send and receive messages even if they don't have access to the Internet.

## Goals

The primary goal is to help communities disconnected from the Internet, so that they can stay in touch locally and with their loved ones abroad. We're particularly interested in serving those who are disconnected due to orders from their local government.

And because we're the team behind [Awala](https://awala.network), a secondary goal is to contribute to its adoption by offering one of the first native apps. We hope that this will, in turn, showcase the benefits of Awala and help us improve it based on first-hand experience with a real-world service.

## Meaning

"Letro" is an [Ido](https://www.idolinguo.org.uk/general.htm) word which translates to "letter" (as in mail). It's pronounced _LEH-troh_, with a trilled "R" like in Spanish.
