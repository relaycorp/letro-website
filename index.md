# Letro

Letro is a service like email, but it's designed to solve the challenges we face in the 21st century.

Like email, Letro is decentralised and based on open standards. Unlike email, all messages are end-to-end encrypted, spamming and phishing are be virtually impossible, and users can send and receive messages even if they don't have access to the Internet.

Here's Letro in action:

## About

Letro is an [open source](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aletro+org%3Arelaycorp&type=repositories) project by [Relaycorp](https://relaycorp.tech), the company behind [Awala](https://awala.network) and [VeraId](https://veraid.net) (which also power Letro). Letro has been funded by the [Open Technology Fund](https://opentech.fund).

"Letro" is an [Ido](https://www.idolinguo.org.uk/general.htm) word which translates to "letter" (as in mail). It's pronounced _LEH-troh_, with a trilled "R" like in Spanish.
