        <h1 class="title">Overview</h1>

        <p>
            Letro will be a service like email, but it's designed to solve the challenges we face in the 21st century.
            Like email, Letro will be decentralised and based on open standards. Unlike email, all messages will be
            end-to-end encrypted, spamming and phishing will be virtually impossible, and users could send and receive
            messages even if they don't have access to the Internet.
        </p>

        <h1 class="title">Goals</h1>

        <p>
            The primary goal is to help communities disconnected from the Internet, so that they can stay in touch
            locally and with their loved ones abroad. We're particularly interested in serving those who are
            disconnected due to orders from their local government.
        </p>

        <p>
            And because we're the team behind <a href="https://awala.network/">Awala</a>, a secondary goal is to
            contribute to its adoption by offering one of the first native apps. We hope that this will, in turn,
            showcase the benefits of Awala and help us improve it based on first-hand experience with a real-world
            service.
        </p>

        <h1 class="title">Meaning</h1>
        <p>
            "Letro" is an <a href="https://www.idolinguo.org.uk/general.htm">Ido</a> word which translates to "letter"
            (as in mail). It's pronounced <em>LEH-troh</em>, with a trilled "R" like in Spanish.
