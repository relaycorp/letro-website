# Terms of Service

Relaycorp, Inc. offers users Letro ("Letro"), which provides an email-like service that is decentralized and based on open standards, but that is end-to-end encrypted, on which spamming and phishing will be virtually impossible, and allowing users to send and receive messages even if they don't have access to the Internet. You agree to our Terms of Service ("Terms") by installing or using our apps, services, or website (together, "Services").

For ease of reference, when referring to Letro in these terms of service, we are referring to both Relaycorp, Inc. and Letro.

## About our services

**Minimum Age**. You must be at least 13 years old to use our Services. The minimum age to use our Services without parental approval may be higher in your home country.

**Account Registration**. You may register for our services through one of two methods: (1) by requesting a free account under a domain name operated by Relaycorp, or (2) by linking an existing account from a domain name managed by you or your organization.

**Privacy of user data**. Letro does not sell, rent or monetize your personal data or content in any way -- ever.

Please read our [Privacy Policy](./privacy-policy.md) to understand how we safeguard the information you provide when using our Services. For the purpose of operating our Services, you agree to our data practices as described in our Privacy Policy, as well as the transfer of your encrypted information and metadata to the United States and other countries where we have or use facilities, service providers or partners. Examples would be Third Party Providers processing your support tickets.

**Software**. In order to enable new features and enhanced functionality, you consent to downloading and installing updates to our Services.

**Fees and Taxes**. You are responsible for data and mobile carrier fees and taxes associated with the devices on which you use our Services.

## Using Letro

**Our Terms and Policies**. You must use our Services according to our Terms and posted policies. If we disable your account for a violation of our Terms, you will not create another account without our permission.

**Legal and Acceptable Use**. You agree to use our Services only for legal, authorized, and acceptable purposes. You will not use (or assist others in using) our Services in ways that: (a) violate or infringe the rights of Letro, our users, or others, including privacy, publicity, intellectual property, or other proprietary rights; (b) involve sending illegal content or impermissible communications, including phishing attempts.

**Harm to Letro**. You must not (or assist others to) access, use, modify, distribute, transfer, or exploit our Services in unauthorized manners, or in ways that harm Letro, our Services, or systems. For example you must not (a) gain or try to gain unauthorized access to our Services or systems; (b) disrupt the integrity or performance of our Services; (c) create accounts for our Services through unauthorized or automated means; (d) collect information about our users in any unauthorized manner; or (e) sell, rent, or charge for our Services.

**Keeping Your Account Secure**. Letro embraces privacy by design and does not have the ability to access your messages. You are responsible for keeping your device and your Letro account safe and secure. If you lose your phone, follow the steps on our Support site to re-register for our Services. Please note, however, that Letro does not store your data in any backup form, so if you lose your phone, any data associated with your account will also be lost.

**No Access to Emergency Services**. Our Services do not provide access to emergency service providers like the police, fire department, hospitals, or other public safety organizations. Make sure you can contact emergency service providers through a mobile, fixed-line telephone, or other service.

**Third-party services**. Our Services may allow you to access, use, or interact with third-party content, and other products and services. When you use third-party services, their terms and privacy policies govern your use of those services.

## Your Rights and License with Letro

Your Rights. You own the information you submit through our Services.

**Letro's Rights**. We own all copyrights, trademarks, domains, logos, trade dress, trade secrets, patents, and other intellectual property rights associated with our Services. You may not use our copyrights, trademarks, domains, logos, trade dress, patents, and other intellectual property rights unless you have our written permission. To report copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property infringement, please contact support@relaycorp.tech.

**Letro's License to You**. Letro is licensed to its users under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3; provided, however, that this license does not apply to any commercial products/services offered by Relaycorp, which will be governed by separate terms of use.

You agree that you shall use your own server or data storage device in the event you utilize your own instance of the Services. You must ensure that Relaycorp/Letro do not incur additional hosting costs required to support your instance. Letro's server is used solely to request a free account, claim an account under a user-controlled domain name, and connect with other users.

## Availability of Service

Letro endeavours to keep the Service accessible as consistently as possible. However, and particularly for reasons of maintenance, security or capacity or due to events beyond the control of Letro (such as disruptions and interruptions of public communication systems, power failures, etc.), disruptions or temporary cessation of operation of the Service may occur. Letro further reserves the right to temporarily restrict the use of the Service for reasons of maintenance, security or capacity. This may result in a failure of communications to be transmitted on time, correctly, or at all.

The Service may be limited or unavailable in certain countries or regions.

The Service is decentralised, and as a result, data is backed up or stored in the cloud. As a result, in the event you delete the data off of or lose your phone, your data will be lost.

## Disclaimers and Limitations

**Disclaimers**. YOU USE OUR SERVICES AT YOUR OWN RISK AND SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING DISCLAIMERS. WE PROVIDE OUR SERVICES ON AN "AS IS" BASIS WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND FREEDOM FROM COMPUTER VIRUS OR OTHER HARMFUL CODE. LETRO DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED BY US IS ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR USEFUL, THAT OUR SERVICES WILL BE OPERATIONAL, ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR SAFE, OR THAT OUR SERVICES WILL FUNCTION WITHOUT DISRUPTIONS, DELAYS, OR IMPERFECTIONS. WE DO NOT CONTROL, AND ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR, CONTROLLING HOW OR WHEN OUR USERS USE OUR SERVICES. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS OR INFORMATION (INCLUDING CONTENT) OF OUR USERS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES. YOU RELEASE US, AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, PARTNERS, AND AGENTS (TOGETHER, "LETRO PARTIES") FROM ANY CLAIM, COMPLAINT, CAUSE OF ACTION, CONTROVERSY, OR DISPUTE (TOGETHER, "CLAIM") AND DAMAGES, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, RELATING TO, ARISING OUT OF, OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH ANY SUCH CLAIM YOU HAVE AGAINST ANY THIRD PARTIES.

**Limitation of liability**. THE LETRO PARTIES WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INDIRECT, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES RELATING TO, ARISING OUT OF, OR IN ANY WAY IN CONNECTION WITH OUR TERMS, US, OR OUR SERVICES, EVEN IF THE LETRO PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY RELATING TO, ARISING OUT OF, OR IN ANY WAY IN CONNECTION WITH OUR TERMS, US, OR OUR SERVICES WILL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100). THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMER OF CERTAIN DAMAGES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. THE LAWS OF SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN OUR TERMS, IN SUCH CASES, THE LIABILITY OF THE LETRO PARTIES WILL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

Letro shall not be liable for the temporary non-availability of the Service or for the failure of any or all of the features offered in relation to the Service. In particular, Letro shall not be liable for damages caused by software defects, hacker attacks or other problems caused via the Internet.

## Resolving Disputes and Ending Terms

**Resolving disputes**. You agree to resolve any Claim you have with us relating to or arising out of our Terms, us, or our Services exclusively in a United States District Court or state court in Delaware. You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating all such disputes. The laws of the State of Delaware govern our Terms, as well as any disputes, whether in court or arbitration, which might arise between Letro and you, without regard to conflict of law provisions.

**Ending these Terms**. You may end these Terms with Letro at any time by deleting Letro from your device and discontinuing use of our Services. We may modify, suspend, or terminate your access to or use of our Services anytime for any reason, such as if you violate the letter or spirit of our Terms or create harm, risk, or possible legal exposure for Letro. The following provisions will survive termination of your relationship with Letro: "Licenses," "Disclaimers," "Limitation of Liability," "Resolving dispute," "Availability" and "Ending these Terms," and "General".

## General

Letro may update the Terms from time to time. When we update our Terms, we will update the "Last Modified" date associated with the updated Terms. Your continued use of our Services confirms your acceptance of our updated Terms and supersedes any prior Terms. You will comply with all applicable export control and trade sanctions laws. Our Terms cover the entire agreement between you and Letro regarding our Services. If you do not agree with our Terms, you should stop using our Services.

If we fail to enforce any of our Terms, that does not mean we waive the right to enforce them. If any provision of the Terms is deemed unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision shall be deemed severable from our Terms and shall not affect the enforceability of the remaining provisions. Our Services are not intended for distribution to or use in any country where such distribution or use would violate local law or would subject us to any regulations in another country. We reserve the right to limit our Services in any country. If you have specific questions about these Terms, please contact us at support@relaycorp.tech.
