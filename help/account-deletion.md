# Account deletion

To delete a free account under a Relaycorp-managed domain name (e.g., `applepie.rocks`, `cuppa.fans`), simply delete the account from the _Settings_ screen in Letro.

To delete an account under a domain managed by a third party, delete account from the _Settings_ screen in Letro and then contact that third party.
